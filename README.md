# Rebase exercise three

Rebase the `my-feature` branch onto the tip of the `master` branch.

Note that the `my-feature` branch has been branched from the `develop`
branch, so you will need to use the `--onto` argument


Your final commit graph should look like this:

```
* 6072c40 - (HEAD -> my-feature) Z
* c2e9824 - Y
* 0ee18b3 - X
* ebcbf6e - (master) E
* 1ae3b0f - D
* 9b68f1c - C
| * a52e366 - (develop)
| * 6324f97 - O
| * 6953e42 - N
| * 5e60b41 - M
|/
* 2f6b454 - B
* 704c4ee - A
* 1cf0d93 - Initial commit
```

(Note that your SHAs will be different.)
